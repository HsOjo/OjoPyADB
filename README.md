# OjoPyADB

This project is written with Python 3, which aims to provide a simple and practical ADB function for Python 3.

## Introduction

The module currently integrates the following functions:

* Application management (installation, uninstall, start, stop, clear data, freeze, get status, etc.)
* File management (pull, push, copy, move, delete, view and other basic functions)
* Input control (text, key, click, slide)
* Display management (adjust resolution, DPI, screenshot)

In the future, corresponding functions will be added according to the requirements.

from pyadb import PyADB, KeyCode

adb = PyADB()
print(adb.version)
print(adb.devices)
print(adb.forward.list)
if len(adb.devices) > 0:
    device = list(adb.devices.values())[0]
    print(device.abi)
    print(device.sn, device.state)
    print(device.app.current_activity)
    print(device.input.keyevent(KeyCode.HOME))
    print(device.input.keyevent(KeyCode.SEARCH))
    device.input.text('Hello World!\tThis input method is ASCII only...')
    print(device.file.listdir('/sdcard/'))
    print(device.display.size())
    img = device.display.screen_cap()
    print(len(img))
    logcat = device.logcat
    logcat.set_filterspecs(**{'ActivityManager': logcat.PRIORITY_INFO})
    print(logcat.dump())
```
